Generated resource .c and .h files will be placed here for all found .resource files. As
long as xml file under src/ has .resource extension it will be found and built here

There are two files already src/data/lib.resource and src/demos/demo/demo.resource as
example

They need to be included in source files list in makefile like:
	${RESOURCE}name.*
